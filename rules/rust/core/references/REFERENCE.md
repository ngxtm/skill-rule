## References

- [**Error Handling**](error-handling.md) - Result, thiserror, anyhow patterns
- [**Ownership Patterns**](ownership-patterns.md) - Borrowing, lifetimes, smart pointers

## Quick Checks

- [ ] Use Result for fallible operations
- [ ] Use thiserror for library errors, anyhow for applications
- [ ] Prefer borrowing over ownership transfer
- [ ] Use `?` operator for error propagation
- [ ] Derive Clone, Debug for data types
